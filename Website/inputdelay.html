	<h1>Before We Start</h1>

	<p>It's very good to know that in most cases of "input delay", it's almost always placebo. This meaning it's all in your head, and yes. Your brain can screw you over like this. Also no matter what, you'll never get 1ms or 0ms input delay. By the laws of physics defined by our universe. Light can only move so fast. Electricity traveling at light speed, you'll always have some delay. The lowest amount of delay a mouse can have in current day is about 8ms - 10ms. With all this being said there are ways to improve your input delay.</p>

	<h1>CPU Overclocking</h1>

	<p>Overclocking your CPU can reduce frame times. Hence, frames being displayed quicker. This meaning the overall input delay is less. Now overclocking our CPUs are different for all of us. I would say most people can't overclock unless you have a clockable CPU. These being K scew intel CPUs. I'm not sure about Ryzen though. The way you overclock is also very unique depending on your motherboard. You can most likely find a video on YouTube for how to overclock your CPU on that specific motherboard that you have. It's not something I can show you on here because its different for all motherboards.</p>

	<h1>Timer Resolution</h1>

	<p>I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty on this, but timer resolution helps if you don't have a 240hz monitor. If you have a 240hz, its pointless to use this program. The programs can be found <a href="https://timerresolution.soft112.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Download and launch it. It should be very straight forward from there. Once you have selected the appropriate settings in the application, do not close it. You must leave it open if you want to reap the benefits it lends you.</p>

	<h1>Display Scaling</h1>

	<p>If you use a stretched resolution or resolution that isn't native to your monitor. You should be using display scaling. This reduces input delay quite a bit if you're scaling you resolution. There is a great video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW3VjZFJCdBJyvaoaTgacyg" target="_blank">ItsJerian</a> on YouTube showcasing this. You can find the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5vqsM9lmXg" target="_blank">here</a>. Follow every step exactly. If you don't you may have monitor issues afterwards.</p>

	<h1>Gaming Mode</h1>

	<p>Make sure you use gaming mode on your monitor / TV. This can significantly reduce input delay if you're playing on an older monitor or just a TV in general. This should be fairly easy to find if you take a few minutes to look through your monitor / TVs menu.</p>

	<h1>Super Indepth Guide</h1>

	<p>If you want a <b>SUPER</b> indepth guide on how to minimize input delay. I should refer you the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/chrisfreeth" target="_blank">Fr33thy</a>. He has an amazing guide on how to remove input delay. Be warned, I believe the video is upwards of an hour, but he goes into depth on <b>EVERYTHING</b>. By far the best tutorial on youtube. You can find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KIG3M_hxBA" target="_blank">here</a>. Following this guide should get you the best possible results. Be warned, this is a Fortnite guide, but most of the steps apply to everyone.</p>
