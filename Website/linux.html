	<h1>Linux</h1>

	<p>Linux is a very secure, fast, and amazing operating system overall. If you're using Linux for productivity, you're doing the right thing. However there are some distrobutions of Linux that I'm going to recommend. I recommend first Arch Linux. Arch Linux is a Linux distrobution where you do the install through a command line. This is far more advanced than most operating systems to setup, but you get exactly what you want when you do set it up this way. Another distrobution I recommend is Arco Linux. Arco Linux is a distrobution of Linux that is based off of Arch. This gives Arch Linux a GUI based installer essentially and some nicely setup configs out of the gate. If I were to run Linux this is the distrobution I would choose. Lastly I'm going to recommend Manjaro. All three of the Linux distrobutions I've mentioned are Arch Based and this is for a reason. The Arch Linux respositories are absolutely amazing. You can find almost anything in the Arch Linux repositories. It is truly a gift to Linux as an operating system.</p>

	<h1>Arch Based Distrobutions</h1>

	<p>Arch based distrobutions are some of the most popular in Linux. And for good reason. Arch based Linux distrobutions all offer the same thing. The Arch Linux repositories. The Arch Linux repositories have absolutely everything you'll ever need. I'll bet you they have every application you need a run on your system. Also another great thing about Arch Linux distros are is they're all highly modifiable. Everything you have on the system you usually add yourself. Which I love. No unnecessary bloat like Windows.</p>

	<h1>Desktop Environments vs Window Managers</h1>

	<p>If you don't know what desktop environments or window managers are, let me explain. A desktop environment is the GUI interface you have in Linux. They can drastically change how the operating system looks. You can have a desktop environment that mimics MacOS. You can have one that mimics Windows. The options are endless. As for windows manager though, window managers are far more configurable. Generally less user friendly, it takes a lot more coding configuration files than just a standard desktop environment does. Window managers are far lighter usually only needing 200MB - 500MB of ram at idle. If you want to learn about window manager theres a good video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg" target="_blank">DistroTube</a> on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obzf9ppODJU" target="_blank">here</a>. Here is an hour long video explaining tiling window managers which are the more popular version of window managers. When it comes to me, I prefer using window managers over desktop environments because my productivity level is increased. Using keybinds on the keyboard is my preferance rather than using the mouse for functions. It tends to save a lot of time.</p>

	<h1>Package Managers / Installers</h1>

	<p>In Linux there is this thing called a package installer / manager. This is a way to install packages from a store like UI or a command line where most applications are hosted. In Arch Linux you would use a terminal and use a command like the following "sudo pacman -S firefox" to get an application and install it on the computer. You can also update absolutely everything on the computer at once including the operating system with just one line in the terminal that looks like this "sudo pacman -Syu". This saves massive amounts of time rather than updating every application individually. This also cuts down on time for downloading applications as you don't even need to touch the web browser at all. All the packages you install are manually checked for viruses pretty much 24/7 so you know you're getting a safe installation. This is a reason why Linux is far more secure. You don't risk installing a infected application unless something goes <b>REALLY</b> wrong in the repositories. Overall, the package installers / managers in Linux make it a huge attraction for power users wanting to save time and just have a far quicker and easier experience rather than finding the correct website and hoping its not a trojan.</p>

	<h1>Security</h1>

	<p>Linux is a free and open-source operating system which means anyone can look at the code and find vulnerabilities in the operating system. But this also goes the other way. For ever 1 bad person trying to create a trojan for the operating system you have a 1000 good people trying to patch and make the operating system more secure. This operating system is so secure and stable that even Microsoft hosts their own servers on Linux. Stablity and security is a huge attraction to Linux and for good reason.</p>

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>

	<p>Linux is a very good operating system and has tons of variety. Its by far the most modular operating system, you can fit it exactly how you want and need. The gaming is also decent on here. Definitely second to Windows but its definitely still very playable. Linux's strongest asset though is definitely it's security though. How stable and secure the operating system is makes it perfect for people who are developers, people who value privacy, or people who just want to have a truly modular and customizable experience when it comes to making an operating system fit them.</p>
