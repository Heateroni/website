	<h1>June 11th 2021</h1>

	<p>Today I've created my own repositories on GitHub. These will come in use for almost everything. My first use for them was going to see how fast I could get a fresh install of Arco Linux on a separate computer working with my configs. I believe I was up and running with my configs on the PC in 10 ish minutes from the login screen. I'm actually writing this blog post on that separate computer right now. All of my repositories that I've used for this project are available <a href="https://github.com/Heateroni" target="_blank">here</a>. Including the Website files. This is really just for me, but I though if people want to see the source, and how bad I am at HTML, they can. Thats is for today.</p>
