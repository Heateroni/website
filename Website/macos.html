	<h1>MacOS</h1>

	<p>MacOS is a very refined operating system. It definitely not my favorite but if you have apple hardware it can be very beneficial. If you do have a MacBook or such you can run all three operating systems I mentioned on your computer. Making this a dream for application developers. Gaming on Mac is awful at best. But if you have a Macintosh I'm sure you're not a gamer. You're most likely a student or application developer. And in both of those cases and maybe even more, MacOS may perfectly suit your needs, and thats perfect. It's just not my favorite operating system to use.</p>

	<h1>Refined</h1>
	<p>MacOS is the most refined operating system by far. This is something thats verying important to Apple. Having all of their products work seamlessly with each other. If you have an iPhone, you can text seamlessly from your Macintosh just for an example. This is just one way that Apple has refined their operating system. There is a problem with this though. Since apple is a very big proponent of proprietary software. You can't modify anything in the operating system to fit your needs compared to Linux or even Windows. You basically like it or you don't. Also compatibility for MacOS isn't the best. Not nearly as good as Windows or Linux even though it makes up a larger portion of users compared to Linux. Not to mention the gaming on MacOS is not exactly ideal. It's never been their focus to offer gaming computers though. It's all about the productivity which is its strong point. What it does well is does better than almost any other operating system.</p>

	<h1>Developers</h1>

	<p>MacOS may be ideal for developers. Seeing as you can run ever popular operating system on it opposed to trying to run MacOS in a VM on Windows or Linux. Bootcamp makes switching between operating systems seamless and is very good for developers who want to test applications on other operating systems aswell as their own. This is probably the strongest asset that MacOS has on their side.</p>

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>

	<p>I can't really say much on MacOS because I have very little experience with it. It's definitely my least favorite out of the three I talk about on my website. But if you like it and you're a developer this may be the perfect operating system for you. It just doesn't fit be well.</p>
