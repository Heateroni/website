	<h1>My Operating Systems</h1>

	<p>I run two operating systems on my work station. I run Arch Linux. The windows manager being XMonad. I also run Windows 10. This is what's known as, a dual boot. When you boot off of two operating systems because you like them both for different reasons. I use Linux for productivity and developing. Hell, I'm developing this website right now on my Arch install. And I use Windows to game and chat to my friends.</p>

	<h1>Arch Linux</h1>

	<p>I run Arch Linux because its a super light operating system seeing you know how to set it up. On idle I can get memory usage as low as 300M / 32G. The lowest I can get idling on Windows 10 is around 1.5G / 32G. Another reason is because Linux is general is very safe and private. I can sleep at night knowing that I keep all of my sensitive information on Linux. I wouldn't trust Windows 10. It seems neither does Microsoft seeing that they host a ton of their servers on Linux machines.</p>

	<h1>XMonad</h1>

	<p>Instead of a desktop environment like most people use, I use a window manager. These are far lighter on the system and they increase productivity. Atleast for me. It's highly dependant on how you configure your window manager though. If you don't know you keybinds, or aren't comfortable with them, it's pointless. You'd just be hurting yourself. The point of these window managers is to speed up your productivity by using the keyboard for actions normally done by a mouse. This will make you "computing game" exponentially faster.</p>

	<h1>Windows 10</h1>

	<p>I use a custom Windows 10 ISO that has most of the telemetry and bloatware completely ripped out of the install. This makes the install far snappier and a lot better for privacy. Of course the privacy part is highly dependent on the version on Windows 10 you're modifying. If its not supported anymore, its not ideal. Make sure its supported by security updates. This is why I so highly recommend the LTSC Windows 10 version. This has all of the default bloat ripped out. It receives security updates for 2 years and it super fast and light. The only down side being is getting a license key. It's very difficult and you'll need to talk to a 3rd party source I believe. So you're not in contact with Microsoft purchasing these keys at all.</p>

	<h1>Linux Repositories</h1>

	<p>I have a GitHub setup for my configs that I use on my everyday Linux system. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/Heateroni/dotfiles" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have any familiarity with XMonad you'll understand how to use these files. Be warned. The XMobar and XMonad I use is extremely simple. This is how I like it. You're welcome to make changes to the configs obviously but if you use a lot of imports etc. This has almost none of that. When I was configuring my system. I wanted a system that could run on anything with great efficiency and speed. I use a very powerful workstation for my main machine, but I also use computers made 10 years ago so I just like to have everything compatible out of the gate, so whatever I'm working on. I can pickup where I left off almost imediately with 0 tweaking.</p>
